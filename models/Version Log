model_v1.keras
    - Initial implementation of model recognition
    - Acc: Not recorded
    - Loss: Not recorded
    - Dataset: ./data/emnist-balanced
        - 47 classes
        - 131,600 total samples
    - Issues/Notes:
        Model was trained on data without transpose being applied to it,
        therefore, for prediction the input must be transposed or transformed.

model_v2.keras
    - Implements same model as v1 with data training data being transposed correctly
    - Acc: high 91 (not recorded at the time)
    - Loss: Not recorded
    - Dataset: ./data/emnist-balanced
        - 47 classes
        - 131,600 total samples
    - Issues/Notes:
        Predictions tend to confused E with I if E is not written with a curve to it,
        also some other predictions mistakes but those are expected

model_v3.keras
    - Implemented to try and handle mis-predictions better by using larger dataset (same model)
    - Acc: 91.76        val_acc: 90.39
    - Loss: 20.75       val_loss: 26.97
    - Dataset: ./data/emnist-bymerge
        - 47 classes
        - 814,255 total samples
    - Issues/Notes:
